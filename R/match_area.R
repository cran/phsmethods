#' @title Translate geography codes into area names
#'
#' @description `match_area` takes a geography code or vector of geography
#' codes. It matches the input to the corresponding value in the
#' [area_lookup()] dataset and returns the corresponding area name.
#'
#' @details `match_area` relies predominantly on the standard 9 digit
#' geography codes. The only exceptions are:
#' \itemize{
#' \item RA2701: No Fixed Abode
#' \item RA2702: Rest of UK (Outside Scotland)
#' \item RA2703: Outside the UK
#' \item RA2704: Unknown Residency
#' }
#'
#' `match_area` caters for both current and previous versions of geography
#' codes (e.g 2014 and 2019 Health Boards).
#'
#' It can account for geography codes pertaining to Health Boards, Council
#' Areas, Health and Social Care Partnerships, Intermediate Zones, Data Zones
#' (2001 and 2011), Electoral Wards, Scottish Parliamentary Constituencies,
#' UK Parliamentary Constituencies, Travel to work areas, National Parks,
#' Community Health Partnerships, Localities (S19), Settlements (S20) and
#' Scotland.
#'
#' `match_area` returns a non-NA value only when an exact match is present
#' between the input value and the corresponding variable in the
#' [area_lookup()] dataset. These exact matches are sensitive to both
#' case and spacing. It is advised to inspect [area_lookup()] in the
#' case of unexpected results, as these may be explained by subtle differences
#' in transcription between the input value and the corresponding value in the
#' lookup dataset.
#'
#' @param x A geography code or vector of geography codes.

#' @return Each geography code within Scotland is unique, and consequently
#' `match_area` returns a single area name for each input value.

#' Any input value without a corresponding value in the
#' [area_lookup()] dataset will return an NA output value.

#' df %>% mutate(name = match_area(code))
