\title{Create age groups}
\usage{
create_age_groups(x, from = 0, to = 90, by = 5, as_factor = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of numeric values}

\item{from}{the start of the smallest age group. The default is \code{0}.}

\item{to}{the end point of the age groups. The default is \code{90}.}

\item{by}{the size of the age groups. The default is \code{5}.}

\item{as_factor}{The default behaviour is to return a character vector. Use
\code{TRUE} to return a factor vector instead.}
}
\value{
A character vector, where each element is the age group for the
corresponding element in \code{x}. If \code{as_factor = TRUE}, a factor
vector is returned instead.
}
\description{
\code{create_age_groups()} takes a numeric vector and assigns each age to the
appropriate age group.
}
\details{
The \code{from}, \code{to} and \code{by} values are used to create distinct
age groups. \code{from} dictates the starting age of the lowest age group,
and \code{by} indicates how wide each group should be. \code{to} stipulates
the cut-off point at which all ages equal to or greater than this value
should be categorised together in a \verb{to+} group. If the specified value
of \code{to} is not a multiple of \code{by}, the value of \code{to} is
rounded down to the nearest multiple of \code{by}.

The default values of \code{from}, \code{to} and \code{by} correspond to the

age groups.

\examples{
age <- c(54, 7, 77, 1, 26, 101)

create_age_groups(age)
create_age_groups(age, from = 0, to = 80, by = 10)

# Final group may start below 'to'
create_age_groups(age, from = 0, to = 65, by = 10)

# To get the output as a factor:
create_age_groups(age, as_factor = TRUE)
